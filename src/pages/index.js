      <p>
        I'm Tony, currently an undergraduate studying <a href = "https://www.cs.washington.edu">computer science</a> at 
        the University of Washington, but originally from sunny San Jose, California. 
        
        I'm broadly interested in human-computer interaction: can we use 
        multi-modal methods in augmented reality to enable futuristic technology? 
      </p>

      <p>
        At UW, I'm tackling questions like these at the <a href = "https://makeabilitylab.cs.washington.edu">Makeability Lab</a>, 
        where I'm developing a holographic running assistant with the Apple Vision Pro mentored by <a href = "https://jaewook-lee.com/">Jaewook Lee</a>. 
        
        I'm also building driverless software for our first-ever fully autonomous racecar with <a href = "https://www.uwformulamotorsports.com/">UW Formula Motorsports</a>, 
        and work part-time at the <a href = "https://www.washington.edu/ima/uwild/climb-with-rec/climbing-spaces/crags-climbing-center/">UW Crags Climbing Center</a> in the IMA. 
      </p>

      <p>
        Before UW, I previously sent a few experiments to the ISS, built a CubeSat, researched 
        computational biology, and played chess competitively, where I once thought I was going
        to be a national master, astronaut, or aerospace engineer.
      </p>

      <p>
        In my free time, I like to try new coffee shops in the U-District, climb plastic rocks at 
        Seattle Bouldering Project, cook pastas, curate my Spotify playlists, and collect bucket hats.
      </p>

      <p>
        I'm always down to chat. Feel free to reach out! 
      </p>
